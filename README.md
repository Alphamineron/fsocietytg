# ML Initiative
----------------------
Repository for collaborating with others to learn Machine Learning and Deep Learning Solutions.

# Instructions
* Create a new branch with your name using the command `git checkout -b <branch-name>`, with branch name in format <first-name>"-"<last-name>. eg.- `git checkout -b Ankur-Singh`.
* All commits should be made to your own branch, **Never commit to master**. To prevent this always check what branch you're on before committing any changes, command to check current branch git branch, command to checkout(change to) a branch, `git checkout <branch-name>`.
* Steps to submit your code.
  * Add files to be committed using the command git add . (the "." after add means all files in the current directory will be added)
  * Add a descriptive commit message for the same. Command - `git commit -m "<msg>"`.
    Format - Project #<Project-no.> : description. Mention any errors or issues in the code in the commit message, if any.
* Finally, push your code. command - `git push origin <branch-name>`
```
git checkout -b Ankur-Singh
git checkout Ankur-Singh	// to make sure you are in your own branch
git add .	// adds all files and subfolders to be committed in the current directory
git commit -m "Task #0: description"
git push origin Ankur-Singh
```
* Currently Master has no specified purpose
* Develop the [wiki](https://github.com/Alphamineron/mlinitiative/wiki) in order to include relevant learning resources

# Order of Learning<sup>*</sup>
1. GIT
2. Python 3.x
3. Anaconda (setting up a conda environment)
4. Jupyter notebooks
  OPTIONAL: Setup Atom for personal use
5. numpy
6. matplotlib
7. pandas
8. scipy
9. Basic Concepts of Machine Learning
10. Multivariate Calculus and Linear Algebra
11. Follow and Develop projects
12. Indulge in advanced Machine Learning Concepts
13. Follow research articles and papers
14. Practice on Kaggle, Hackerrank, CodeChef, etc

Note: You're neither limited to this order nor it's content, it'd be recommended if you follow the given order in a *"learn-moveon-revisit"* fashion and write code as you learn the concepts.

<sup>*</sup> <sub><sup>*The order is subject to changes.*</sup></sub>
